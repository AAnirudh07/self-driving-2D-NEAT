# self-driving-2D-NEAT
This repository contains the Python code for creating a self-driving AI based on the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm. NEAT is used to evolve Artificial Neural Networks using genetic algorithmic techniques.

* Each generation has 20 instances.
* Each instance is given a fitness value according to the how long it remained on the track.
* New generations are created until at least one car is able to finish a lap without leaving the track.
